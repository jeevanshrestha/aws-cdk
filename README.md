# Welcome to AWS CDK Python project!

This project provides a starting point for developing cloud infrastructure using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python. It includes all the necessary configuration files and a recommended project structure to help you define AWS resources using familiar Python code. Use this repository to model, provision, and manage your AWS infrastructure as code, leveraging the power and flexibility of the AWS CDK framework.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project. The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory. To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CDK Installation

If you **don't** have CDK installed, install it globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
```

If this is your first time using CDK, run the bootstrap command:

```
$ cdk bootstrap
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

## Clean Up

To destroy the deployed stack and clean up resources, run:

```
$ cdk destroy
```

Enjoy!
